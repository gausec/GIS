#### This repository showcases some of the coursework completed for a graduate-level Geographic Information Systems course (GEOG 6401) at East Carolina University under the guidance of Dr. Hannah Sirianni. In this course, I used ArcGIS Pro mapping and analytics GIS desktop software, Adobe Illustrator, and Microsoft Office. 
#### I acquired a robust understanding of GIS principles and theories essential for mapping and analyzing geographic data. The course honed my proficiency in both basic and advanced ArcGIS Pro functionalities, and it equipped me to critically evaluate literature about GIS and remote sensing-based research.



#### Course Learning Objectives: 
1. Describe capabilities of ArcGIS Pro and use basic ArcGIS Pro functionality. 
2. Organize, store, and manage geographic data in a geodatabase.
3. Solve common coordinate system and map projection issues encountered when working with spatial data.
4. Prepare raster data for use in spatial analysis.
5. Modify and create vector data for feature display and spatial analysis.
6. Use definition queries and join tables to select the right features to display.
7. Analyze and manipulate the spatial attributes of vector datasets using vector geoprocessing tools.
8. Apply basic single and multiple raster geoprocessing tools to solve spatial problems.
9. Employ cartographic principles to generate nice looking maps.
10. Demonstrate the ability to write and run geoprocessing scripts in Python. 
11. Critically evaluate GIS and remote sensing-based research articles.
12. Create a multimedia mapping experiences that are entertaining to read.
