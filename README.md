$${\color{darkblue}\Huge {Geographic \space Information \space Systems \space Coursework }}$$   

#### This repository showcases some of the coursework completed for a graduate-level Geographic Information Systems course (GEOG 6401) at East Carolina University under the guidance of Dr. Hannah Sirianni. In this course, I used ArcGIS Pro mapping and analytics GIS desktop software, Adobe Illustrator, and Microsoft Office. 
#### I acquired a robust understanding of GIS principles and theories essential for mapping and analyzing geographic data. The course honed my proficiency in both basic and advanced ArcGIS Pro functionalities, and it equipped me to critically evaluate literature about GIS and remote sensing-based research.

### Course Learning Objectives: 
1. Describe capabilities of ArcGIS Pro and use basic ArcGIS Pro functionality. 
2. Organize, store, and manage geographic data in a geodatabase.
3. Solve common coordinate system and map projection issues encountered when working with spatial data.
4. Prepare raster data for use in spatial analysis.
5. Modify and create vector data for feature display and spatial analysis.
6. Use definition queries and join tables to select the right features to display.
7. Analyze and manipulate the spatial attributes of vector datasets using vector geoprocessing tools.
8. Apply basic single and multiple raster geoprocessing tools to solve spatial problems.
9. Employ cartographic principles to generate nice looking maps.
10. Demonstrate the ability to write and run geoprocessing scripts in Python. 
11. Critically evaluate GIS and remote sensing-based research articles.
12. Create a multimedia mapping experiences that are entertaining to read.

#### Example:
In this lesson, I created an educational poster-style map illustrating the significant decline of polar sea ice due to climate change since the twentieth century. Using ArcGIS Pro, the goal was to transform extensive satellite data into a visually compelling narrative.
This involved accessing data from the ArcGIS Living Atlas of the World. A polar projection was selected for the map, and the data were reprojected accordingly. Time was spent exploring the dataset to comprehend its attributes. Next, appropriate symbology was chosen to effectively convey the story of sea ice decline. Additionally, base data were symbolized to provide context for the ice data visualizations.
Throughout this process, cartographic skills in ArcGIS Pro were employed to ensure the creation of a professional map layout that communicated the ongoing loss of Arctic sea ice in a clear and impactful manner.

#### Example:
For this lesson, I created a map of historic kingdoms in Africa. A list of the oldest continuously inhabited cities was provided.

Tasks included formatting the locations into a table format and geocoding them. Geocoding involved converting location names into map coordinates. The next step was to review the geocoded results, ensuring accuracy by correcting any misplaced locations. Finally, the map presentation was refined and any necessary adjustments were made before this hypothetical map was shared with the theoretical students.
